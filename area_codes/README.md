This directory contains the files used to create my Anki area code deck.

update_checker.py can be used to see if the website where the data was sourced from has been changed. Presumably this website would be updated if new area codes are added, or existing ones are changed so this would let me know I need to update my deck.

gen_cards.py is the code used to generate a csv file with area codes and relevant info.

anki_import_settings.PNG provides the settings used when importing the csv into Anki. I did have to manually remove one card which Anki erroneously created, but the settings otherwise work perfectly.
